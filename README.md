## Description

Welcome to the NoSQL Social Network API challenge for week 18 of Coding Boot Camp through UCLA Extension. This week's challenge was to build an API for a social network web application using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM and Moment.js to format time. The API uses a NoSQL database to handle large amounts of unstructured data.
